Testing beginner repository for symfony
This is a repository to have a set of php code in GIT, with:
- Testing code with arrays, multiple arrays, nested arrays...
- Test of several functions.
- Test with OO php: classes, methods, objects, etc.
The code is in git to allow the corrections, optimization and any change that will give a better code.
Till now I was working alone, but the reality show me that I must start to work with others developpers, may be from others countries.
To make that in a efficient way I must start to use tools like git...
